Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts.<br>
 It commonly contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, <br> 
 sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Consumed in many countries, it is the most commonly used of the <br> 
 nut butters, a group that also includes cashew butter and almond butter (though peanuts are not <br>
 nuts, peanut butter is culinarily considered a nut butter).
